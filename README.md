The purpose of this test:

    Proof of concept for a client/developer dashboard tool, which would allow the communication of the status of projects and sevices to the client via a concise and attracitive data-vis UX.  The client will be presented with this information visually as a stacked radial bargraph.  The bargraph will be clickable to allow navigation to bring up more granular data about each service ordered to get status updates at a glance.  The interface will allow the client to chat with the developer, as well as presenting the developer with the relevant info.


Template:
    This folder contains files which I used simply to make sure I could get the code I used from DSjs to work.  After some refactoring I was able to do so.

Test 1:
    This folder contains files in which reflect an attempt to alter the orignal code, to make use of the data I need to pass it.  I also am testing to figure out exactly what data is most helpful to display.  I'm anticipating needing a client view and a developer view which will contain additional data.
